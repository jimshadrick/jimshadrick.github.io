As one who tries to stay up with technology trends, I was blown away by just how big and quick this has gone into the mainstream. Some are even going as far as to compare this new technology with ‚Äúsplitting the atom‚Äù üòé So I thought I would present some of my initial impressions and thoughts on this significant development.

OpenAI, an AI research laboratory, recently released ChatGPT its prototype AI chatbot to the public, and it has gained a lot of traction among users for its human-like, detailed answers to inquiries. It interacts in a conversational way with plain english questions that are provided to it. The dialogue format makes it possible for ChatGPT to also answer followup questions, admit its mistakes, challenge incorrect premises, and even reject inappropriate requests.

There have been so many use cases I have seen which people have come up with. Below are just a few of them. Generate and debug code - ChatGPT has been able to generate intricate Python code and code in other languages, as well as debug problems in existing code. One user who had no prior programming experience even used ChatGPT to build a Twitter bot. Generate a marketing strategy - ChatGPT has been used to create a strategy for a website‚Äôs SEO, audit it, and provide tactics to execute the marketing strategy including providing a list of keywords to target. Create an Excel macro - One user who is not technically minded, having studied English in college, asked ChatGPT to write an Excel macro which saved him several hours at work. Creative liberty - ChatGPT has been used to write essays, music, sitcom/movie scripts and jokes. It can also serve as an entry point for research. Other ideas - There are a host of use cases other than these primary ones above. For example one TikTk creator had ChatGPT create a list of dinners for the week for picky eaters, then asked it to put that data into tables to be easier to read, then asked it to put together a shopping list for those meals!

There are also numerous examples on social media of how people are finding many use cases for it. To get started, go to the official ChatGPT page. If you don‚Äôt have an OpenAI account, you‚Äôll need to sign up for one first. While there are many paid services with OpenAI, the account and ChatGPT are both free to use (for now). Once signed in, you can start chatting with it! Heads up: It‚Äôs incredibly addicting.

For example, you can ask it to ‚Äúconvert 75 degrees Fahrenheit to Celsius‚Äù, and you might get an answer like this: To convert 75 degrees Fahrenheit to Celsius, subtract 32 from the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit and then multiply the result by 5/9. In this case, the conversion would be (75 - 32) * 5/9 = 23.8889 degrees Celsius. For something a little more creative and inspiring, I asked ChatGPT to ‚ÄúWrite a sad pop song in the style of Taylor Swift about the smallest kitten in the litter befriending a mouse. After growing close, they are torn apart because they are just too different, but they retain fond, if painful, memories of their time together. Include a chorus and a bridge.‚Äù It sent back the following lyrics: Verse 1: There was a kitten, oh so small Born the runt of a litter six But she didn‚Äôt let that bring her down She fought to survive and to fix Chorus: Her eyes upon a little mouse Scurrying around the barn They became friends, against all odds But they knew they could never be more than that Verse 2: They played and they laughed and they ran Through the fields and the hay But they knew that they could never stay For they were too different, in every way Bridge: The kitten longed to be a cat To roam and to hunt and to bask in the sun But the mouse stayed close to the ground To hide and to sneak and to have some fun Verse 3: One day they were torn apart The kitten was taken to a new home The mouse was left all alone But they both held on to the memories of their time together Chorus: They may have been different, that little mouse and kitten But they shared a bond that will never be broken Though they may be apart, their memories remain Of the friendship they had, before it all came to an end. There are many other examples besides these. The possibilities are virtually endless.

Like any other sophisticated technology, it has the potential to be misused. It was discovered to have racial, gender, and religious bias. In addition, the program has some limitations including a knowledge base that ends in 2021, a tendency to produce incorrect answers, constantly using the same phrases and when given one version of a question. Some sites such as StackOverflow are placing a temporary ban on the use of ChatGPT-generated code. This is because users are trying out ChatGPT to create answers to coding questions, which they then post to StackOverflow ‚Äúwithout the expertise or willingness to verify that the answer is correct prior to posting\". There are also risks in many professional and academic settings. For example, some people online have already tested out whether it‚Äôs possible to have the bot complete an assignment. ‚Äúholyyyy, solved my computer networks assignment using chatGPT‚Äù one person tweeted. Others suggested that its existence could result in the death of the college essay. One technologist went as far as saying that with ChatGPT, ‚ÄúCollege as we know it will cease to exist.‚Äù ","date":"2022-12-08","objectID":"/20221208-obsessedwithchatgpt/:6:0","tags":["AI"],"title":"Everyone Is Obsessed With ChatGPT","uri":"/20221208-obsessedwithchatgpt/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Summary I think ChatGPT is a positive development and one that may revolutionize many aspects of our lives, including customer service, education, and healthcare. However I think there are still lots of questions which remain. For example how will colleges adapt to the proliferation of AI-written essays and computer science assignments? Will the creative industries be decimated by the spread of generative AI? Is machine learning going to create a tsunami of spam that will ruin the web forever? Maybe we should introduce boundaries to it, just so we don‚Äôt fall into a nihilistic pit of insignificance. Humans derive a lot from process, not the final product. Now we‚Äôre creating tools to jump directly to the final product.

I also did not need a full featured CMS like WordPress so began looking at several static website generators like Jekyll, Hugo, Gatsby, etc. Hugo was touted as the fastest framework and seemed to be the easiest to install and setup with less dependencies. There were also has many themes available to choose from compared with the other frameworks. Although I am not a developer by trade, I found out pretty quickly it was easy to install and get run locally. However getting it deployed to GitHub Pages and setup a continuous build workflow was another matter. A lot of this had to do with my limited experience at the time with Git, repositories, and understanding the structure of the Hugo framework.

Rather than repeat all of those steps which are outlined in this article, here were the remaining high level steps I performed: Clone the newly created GitHub Pages repository Open the repository in VSCode (my preferred editor of choice) Install some VSCode extensions to aid in content and editing the site Add a .gitignore file for the development environment and Hugo artifacts Push the development environment settings to GitHub Create a new site using Hugo in the workspace Add the LoveIt theme git submodule add https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt.git themes/LoveIt Update the theme configuration Add some content and test running the site locally Push the changes to GitHub Deploy the site to GitHub Pages Automate future deployments with GitHub Actions There is a lot of detail that is provided in this guide, which is good but does require you to stop and understand what each step is doing. Instead of blindly typing the command lines I would recommend you take the time to read the additional commentary about each step and understand the context of what was being done. This lengthened the time it took for me to complete the setup and deployment really helped in my overall understanding of the site structure and mechanics.
