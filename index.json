I also did not need a full featured CMS like WordPress so began looking at several static website generators like Jekyll, Hugo, Gatsby, etc. Hugo was touted as the fastest framework and seemed to be the easiest to install and setup with less dependencies. There were also has many themes available to choose from compared with the other frameworks. Although I am not a developer by trade, I found out pretty quickly it was easy to install and get run locally. However getting it deployed to GitHub Pages and setup a continuous build workflow was another matter. A lot of this had to do with my limited experience at the time with Git, repositories, and understanding the structure of the Hugo framework.

Rather than repeat all of those steps which are outlined in this article, here were the remaining high level steps I performed: Clone the newly created GitHub Pages repository Open the repository in VSCode (my preferred editor of choice) Install some VSCode extensions to aid in content and editing the site Add a .gitignore file for the development environment and Hugo artifacts Push the development environment settings to GitHub Create a new site using Hugo in the workspace Add the LoveIt theme git submodule add https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt.git themes/LoveIt Update the theme configuration Add some content and test running the site locally Push the changes to GitHub Deploy the site to GitHub Pages Automate future deployments with GitHub Actions There is a lot of detail that is provided in this guide, which is good but does require you to stop and understand what each step is doing. Instead of blindly typing the command lines I would recommend you take the time to read the additional commentary about each step and understand the context of what was being done. This lengthened the time it took for me to complete the setup and deployment really helped in my overall understanding of the site structure and mechanics. Note: I elected to skip the sections on setting up and connecting the site to CloudFlare.

Once I am comfortable with this, I may explore getting a domain name, configuring the site with CloudFlare and even tailoring the look and feel with the site .css. If you are thinking about setting up your own static website on GitHub Pages, I would highly recommend Hugo and using Michael Schnerring’s guide. It will save you a lot of headaches in the end.
