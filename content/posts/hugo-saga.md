## Background
I have wanted to setup a static website to begin writing again and did not want to have to pay for a hosted solution or CMD like WordPress for as little I would be doing initially. In the past I had tried to use Hugo and was able to get a site up and running locally. However when it came to deploying it to a web hosting provide like GitHub or Netlify, it seemed overwhelming.


## Internet Overload
I decided to give it a go and use a long three-day July 4 weekend. I thought that I could get a site setup relatively quickly in a day at most. Boy was I wrong. Setting up a site and deploying it on GitHub Pages has been a long slog. I have spent over 2 days looking at blog article after article. Due to the fact that these articles were of varying levels of complexity or were based on different environment variables as well as different approaches, it has caused me to want to abandon the effort.
