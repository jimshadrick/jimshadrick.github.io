## My Background

I have over fifteen years of experience in corporate finance and over twenty years as a software consultant and project delivery lead for a large multi-national technology corporation. Through my experiences I have cultivated a passion for learning new technologies and solving problems, but I also don't shy away from getting my feet wet in unfamiliar domains. As a result I have developed a diverse set of skills and interests over the years by applying a somewhat [Feynmanian approach](https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/kilcup.1/262/feynman.html) to life: doing things that I like without fretting over where they will lead to.
