## Background
I have over fifteen years experience in corporate finance and have spent the last twenty one years doing software consulting at Microsoft, implementing CRM and ERP systems for enterprise customers. I have however been a computer geek all my life. I love learning new technologies and solving problems. I also don't shy away from getting my feet wet in unfamiliar domains. I have diverse set of interests and like a [Feynmanian approach](https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/kilcup.1/262/feynman.html) to life—doing things that you like without fretting over where they will lead to. On this site I share many of my experiences and viewpoints as well as some of the side projects I am working on.
