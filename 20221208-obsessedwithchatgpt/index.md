# Everyone Is Obsessed With ChatGPT


## Introduction

Across social media and main stream news sites on the internet, people are sharing stories about how they are using ChatGPT to write code, build a web site, write social media posts, draft essays, compile work reports, and a host of other things using OpenAI's chatbot called ChatGPT.

As one who tries to stay up with technology trends, I was blown away by just how big and quick this has gone into the mainstream. Some are even going as far as to compare this new technology with "splitting the atom" ðŸ˜Ž So I thought I would present some of my initial impressions and thoughts on this significant development.

## What is ChatGPT?

OpenAI, an AI research laboratory, recently released [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) its prototype AI chatbot to the public, and it has gained a lot of traction among users for its human-like, detailed answers to inquiries. It interacts in a conversational way with plain english questions that are provided to it. The dialogue format makes it possible for ChatGPT to also answer followup questions, admit its mistakes, challenge incorrect premises, and even reject inappropriate requests.

## Some ChatGPT use cases

ChatGPT was released to the public and as of this writing it has crossed over 1 million users. There have been so many use cases I have seen which people have come up with. Below are just a few of them.

- **Generate and debug code** - ChatGPT has been able to generate intricate Python code and code in other languages, as well as debug problems in existing code. One user who had no prior programming experience even used ChatGPT to build a [Twitter bot](https://medium.com/@rlodha1/how-i-used-chat-gpt-to-build-a-twitter-bot-without-any-programming-language-35bbc43f6ad).

- **Generate a marketing strategy** - ChatGPT has been used to create a strategy for a website's SEO, audit it, and provide tactics to execute the marketing strategy including providing a list of keywords to target.

- **Create an Excel macro** - One user who is not technically minded, having studied English in college, asked ChatGPT to write an Excel macro which saved him several hours at work.

- **Creative liberty** - ChatGPT has been used to write essays, music, sitcom/movie scripts and jokes. It can also serve as an entry point for research.

- **Other ideas** - There are a host of use cases other than these primary ones above. For example one [TikTk creator](https://www.tiktok.com/@zoltronic/video/7174948312146038062?_r=1&_t=8Y21f7DPlZG&is_from_webapp=v1&item_id=7174948312146038062) had ChatGPT create a list of dinners for the week for picky eaters, then asked it to put that data into tables to be easier to read, then asked it to put together a shopping list for those meals!

## How to get started using ChatGPT

There are many articles already on the internet which provide more details of ChatGPT and the associated GPT-3 neural network machine learning model which was trained. There are also numerous examples on social media of how people are finding many use cases for it.

To get started, go to the official [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) page. If you donâ€™t have an OpenAI account, youâ€™ll need to sign up for one first. While there are many paid services with OpenAI, the account and ChatGPT are both free to use (for now). Once signed in, you can start chatting with it! Heads up: Itâ€™s incredibly addicting.

## Some examples

You can ask ChatGPT a question, and itâ€™ll answer it not only to the best of its abilities, but as if a human wrote the response, sometimeâ€™s even getting a little wordy. For example, you can ask it to "_convert 75 degrees Fahrenheit to Celsius_", and you might get an answer like this:

> To convert 75 degrees Fahrenheit to Celsius, subtract 32 from the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit and then multiply the result by 5/9. In this case, the conversion would be (75 - 32) \* 5/9 = 23.8889 degrees Celsius.

For something a little more creative and inspiring, I asked ChatGPT to "_Write a sad pop song in the style of Taylor Swift about the smallest kitten in the litter befriending a mouse. After growing close, they are torn apart because they are just too different, but they retain fond, if painful, memories of their time together. Include a chorus and a bridge._"

It sent back the following lyrics:

> Verse 1:\
> There was a kitten, oh so small\
> Born the runt of a litter six\
> But she didn't let that bring her down\
> She fought to survive and to fix
>
> Chorus:\
> Her eyes upon a little mouse\
> Scurrying around the barn\
> They became friends, against all odds\
> But they knew they could never be more than that
>
> Verse 2:\
> They played and they laughed and they ran\
> Through the fields and the hay\
> But they knew that they could never stay\
> For they were too different, in every way
>
> Bridge:\
> The kitten longed to be a cat\
> To roam and to hunt and to bask in the sun\
> But the mouse stayed close to the ground\
> To hide and to sneak and to have some fun
>
> Verse 3:\
> One day they were torn apart\
> The kitten was taken to a new home\
> The mouse was left all alone\
> But they both held on to the memories of their time together
>
> Chorus:\
> They may have been different, that little mouse and kitten\
> But they shared a bond that will never be broken\
> Though they may be apart, their memories remain\
> Of the friendship they had, before it all came to an end.

There are many other examples besides these. The possibilities are virtually endless.

## Risks of ChatGPT

Considering all the ways ChatGPT could make generating text helpful, what could possibly go wrong? Like any other sophisticated technology, it has the potential to be misused. It was discovered to have racial, gender, and religious bias. In addition, the program has some limitations including a knowledge base that ends in 2021, a tendency to produce incorrect answers, constantly using the same phrases and when given one version of a question.

Some sites such as StackOverflow are placing a [temporary ban](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/421831/temporary-policy-chatgpt-is-banned) on the use of ChatGPT-generated code. This is because users are trying out ChatGPT to create answers to coding questions, which they then post to StackOverflow â€œwithout the expertise or willingness to verify that the answer is correct prior to posting".

There are also risks in many professional and academic settings. For example, some people online have already tested out whether it's possible to have the bot complete an assignment. "_holyyyy, solved my computer networks assignment using chatGPT_" one person tweeted. Others suggested that its existence could result in the death of the college essay. One technologist went as far as saying that with ChatGPT, "College as we know it will cease to exist."

## Summary

I think ChatGPT is a positive development and one that may revolutionize many aspects of our lives, including customer service, education, and healthcare.

However I think there are still lots of questions which remain. For example how will colleges adapt to the proliferation of AI-written essays and computer science assignments? Will the creative industries be decimated by the spread of generative AI? Is machine learning going to create a tsunami of spam that will ruin the web forever?

Maybe we should introduce boundaries to it, just so we don't fall into a nihilistic pit of insignificance. Humans derive a lot from process, not the final product. Now we're creating tools to jump directly to the final product.
