# About Me


## Welcome
I have over fifteen years of experience in corporate finance and over twenty years doing software consulting at Microsoft. Over the years I developed a passion for learning new technologies and solving problems. On this site I share my knowledge, point of view and perspectives on a variety of topics - not just technology.  In addition I may share some new endeavors as well as side projects I am working on - even if it might look a little foolish or stupid. 

> "If you want to improve, be content to be thought foolish and stupid." 
> – Epictetus

I don't shy away from getting my feet wet in unfamiliar domains and have a diverse set of interests - kind of following a [Feynmanian approach](https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/kilcup.1/262/feynman.html) to life—doing things that I like without fretting over where they will lead to.
